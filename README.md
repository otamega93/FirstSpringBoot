My firsts steps with Spring Boot

This is my first attempt with Spring Boot and my first commit using IntelliJ (so far so good).

It's basically a REST API with two models: users and persons. You can add new persons just when authenticated with the role required (see the personRepository).

This was a test for Spring Boot + Security + MVC + Data REST.
